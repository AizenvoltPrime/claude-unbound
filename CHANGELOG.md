# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Unbound will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.36] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

- **Task System UI**: Replaced the legacy `TodoWrite`-based todo system with the SDK's richer `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList`/`TaskGet` tools. New features include task IDs, subjects, descriptions, dependency tracking (`blockedBy`/`blocks`), owner assignment, and metadata. Tasks are managed in a dedicated `useTaskStore` with input tracking pattern to handle incremental updates.

## [1.0.35] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

- **Modularized Message Router**: Refactored `message-router.ts` (898 lines) into a modular `message-router/` directory following the established `claude-session/` pattern. Handlers are now organized by domain (chat, permissions, settings, sessions, history, workspace, providers) with a thin facade and dependency injection.

## [1.0.34] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Prompt History Not Syncing Across Panels**: Fixed two issues preventing prompt history from syncing correctly: (1) cache not being invalidated when broadcasting new entries, causing newly opened panels to show stale history; (2) race condition where prompts submitted in a single-panel session weren't available when opening a new panel before the SDK wrote to disk. Implemented pending entries buffer that merges with disk history on cache rebuild.

### Changed

- **Renamed Command History to Prompt History**: Updated terminology throughout codebase and documentation to use "prompt history" instead of "command history" for better clarity.

## [1.0.33] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **Subagent-Scoped Accept All**: When clicking "Accept all edits" on a subagent's permission prompt, only that subagent's subsequent tools are auto-approved. The global session mode (e.g., Plan mode) remains unchanged. This allows granular permission control where each subagent can be independently auto-approved without affecting the main session or other subagents.
- **Agent Attribution in Permissions**: Permission prompts now show which agent is requesting the action (e.g., "Explorer agent wants to run this command:") for better visibility into subagent behavior.

## [1.0.32] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **YOLO Mode**: New toggle button that auto-approves all tool calls (except plan approval and questions). Ephemeral per-panel setting that resets on session clear and VS Code restart. Replaces the previous `bypassPermissions` mode.

### Changed

- **Removed `bypassPermissions` Mode**: The persisted `bypassPermissions` permission mode has been removed from VS Code settings.

## [1.0.31] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Image Preview in Chat Input**: Attached images in the chat input can now be clicked to open a full-screen preview, matching the behavior of images in sent messages.

### Fixed

- **Textarea Overflow in Constrained Panels**: Textareas in overlay prompts (AskUserQuestion, PermissionPrompt, SkillApproval, EnterPlanMode, PlanApproval) now scroll when content exceeds container height instead of pushing buttons out of view. Added `overflow-y-auto` to base Textarea component and `max-h-32` constraints to prompt textareas. Answer preview in question submit tab also constrained with scrolling.
- **HTML Rendered Instead of Displayed**: Fixed raw HTML in chat messages being rendered as actual DOM elements instead of displayed as text. For example, `<span>ID</span>` now shows as literal text rather than just "ID".

## [1.0.30] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Dynamic Cache Updates**: Fixed caches not propagating changes to webview panels. Session history, slash commands, skills, MCP servers, plugins, and custom agents now update automatically when underlying files change, without requiring panel refresh.
- **MCP Server File Watcher**: Added file watcher for `.mcp.json` - changes to MCP server configuration are now detected and reflected in the settings panel immediately.

## [1.0.29] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **Namespaced Slash Commands**: Commands in subdirectories (e.g., `~/.claude/commands/gsd/`) now display as `/gsd:command-name` instead of showing a separate badge, matching the plugin command naming convention
- **Improved Badge Visibility**: Source badges (plugin, user) now use neutral colors with border for better visibility across light and dark themes

## [1.0.28] - 2026-01-20

### Changed

- **Performance Optimization**: Panel loading reduced from 20-30s to ~2s first load, ~16ms cached. Single-pass entry processing extracts all data in one iteration instead of 5+ passes. Parallelized session listing and command history extraction. Added caching for sessions list and command history. Removed aggressive cache invalidation on panel focus.

### Fixed

- Fix race condition where panels would get stuck loading when webview sent `ready` before message listener was attached. Message queue now buffers early messages until panel initialization completes.

## [1.0.27] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Clear Context & Auto-Accept**: New plan approval option that clears conversation and starts fresh with the plan injected. Matches Claude Code CLI behavior: preserves planning session, creates new implementation session. Plan content injected as first message with transcript reference to original planning session. Permission mode automatically set to "acceptEdits" for streamlined implementation.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Bind Plan to Session**: New link icon button in chat header to inject a custom plan file into the session. File picker opens to workspace folder by default, filtered to markdown files. If session already has a plan slug, it writes file directly and sends a system message informing Claude of the update. If session has no plan slug, it temporarily enters plan mode and notifies Claude via systemMessage after the acknowledgment.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- MCP tool overlay now displays tool inputs in a collapsible "Input" section with JSON syntax highlighting
- MCP tool overlay responses now use JSON syntax highlighting when content is valid JSON
- "Show full response" button for large MCP tool responses (>2000 chars) with expand/collapse toggle

### Changed

- MCP tool overlay reorganized with collapsible "Input" and "Response" sections
- Tool results no longer truncated when loading session history (full data preserved, UI handles display truncation)

## [1.0.24] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Fix Edit/Write tool cards not scrolling to edit line on fresh sessions when using `acceptEdits` or `bypassPermissions` mode
- Fix Edit/Write tool cards in subagent views not scrolling to edit line (both live and historical sessions)
- Extract `editLineNumber` from SDK tool result consistently across all contexts (main session, subagents, history)

## [1.0.23] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Fix excessive vertical spacing between lines in code blocks (double line breaks caused by `white-space: pre` preserving newlines between Shiki-generated `.line` elements)
- Fix empty lines in code blocks collapsing to zero height (added `min-height` to preserve blank line spacing)

## [1.0.22] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- Clickable MCP tool cards now open a full-screen overlay displaying the tool's output with markdown rendering
- Official MCP (Model Context Protocol) icon for MCP tool cards and overlay
- Visual styling for MCP tool cards: gradient header background, primary color border

### Fixed

- Fix MCP tool output showing raw JSON instead of parsed text when loading sessions from history

## [1.0.21] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- Add Screenshots section to README showcasing chat interface, plan view, and subagent visualization

## [1.0.20] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- **Revert v1.0.13 PATH detection** - Remove automatic Node version manager PATH detection (NVM, FNM, Volta, n, asdf) that was causing issues for some users by adding ALL installed versions to PATH
- Users who need custom PATH for MCP servers on Remote SSH should configure it via `.mcp.json` `env` field (per-server) or configure their shell for non-interactive use (see [Claude Code troubleshooting](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting))

## [1.0.19] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- Fix session history not loading for workspaces with spaces in the path (e.g., `C:\Projects\My Project`)

## [1.0.18] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Clickable file paths in Edit/Write tool cards now open the file and scroll to the exact line where the edit occurred
- Works with both live edits and historical sessions loaded from session history

## [1.0.17] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- Extend Node path detection for MCP servers to include alternative FNM location (`~/.fnm/`) and `/usr/local/bin`
- Fix provider profile deletion not working due to race condition in AlertDialog event handling

## [1.0.16] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- Extended thinking tokens setting now stored in VS Code settings instead of `.claude/settings.local.json`

## [1.0.15] - 2026-01-13

## [1.0.13] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Fix MCP servers failing to start on Remote SSH due to NVM/FNM paths not in PATH (VS Code Server doesn't source shell configs)

## [1.0.12] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- Fix SDK tools and agent discovery failing on Remote SSH due to ripgrep binary lacking execute permissions
- Revert workaround from 1.0.11 (SDK discovery now works with ripgrep fix)

## [1.0.11] - 2026-01-12

- Provider-specific model mapping via ANTHROPIC*DEFAULT*\*\_MODEL environment variables
- Secure credential storage: API keys encrypted via OS keychain (VS Code SecretStorage API), masked input fields in profile editor
- Per-panel provider profiles: Each open panel can have its own provider profile independent of other panels
- Global default profile setting: Configure which profile new panels inherit (separate from per-panel selection)

### Fixed

- Fix streaming text not being captured when assistant message contains non-streamed text content
- Fix concurrent streaming with different provider profiles causing race conditions
- Fix loose model tier matching to use explicit Claude model prefixes
- Add environment variable key validation in profile editor

### Changed
