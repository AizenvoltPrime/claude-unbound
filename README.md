- **Skills Support**: Approve or deny skill invocations
- **Provider Profiles**: Define and switch between API providers (Anthropic, Z.AI, OpenRouter, etc.) with per-panel profile selection
- **Localization**: UI translated into multiple languages, automatically matches VS Code's display language

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Press F5 in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host

## Usage

- Click the Claude Unbound icon in the editor title bar (top right)
- Type your question or request in the chat input
- Press Enter to send (Shift+Enter for new line)
- Review any file changes in the diff view before approving

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Shift+U` / `Cmd+Shift+U`: Focus the chat panel
- `↑` / `↓`: Navigate through command history (like terminal shell)
- `Shift+Tab`: Cycle through permission modes
- `Escape`: Cancel current request (when processing)

### IDE Context

The input bar shows a context indicator that tracks your active editor:

- **Eye icon + line count**: When you have code selected, shows "N lines"
- **Code icon + filename**: When a file is open without selection, shows the filename

Click the indicator to toggle whether the context is included in your next message. When enabled, the selected code (or entire file) is automatically injected into your prompt—no need to manually @mention or paste code.

### Image Attachments

Paste images directly into the chat input with `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V`:

- **Supported formats**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- **Size limit**: 5MB per image
- **Max attachments**: 10 images per message

Attached images appear as thumbnails below the input. Hover over a thumbnail to reveal the remove button. Click any image in the conversation to open it in a lightbox.

#### @ Mention Autocomplete

- `@`: Trigger autocomplete popup for files and agents
- `↑` / `↓`: Navigate suggestions
- `Tab` / `Enter`: Insert selected item
- `Escape`: Close popup

**Mention types:**

| Syntax                   | Description                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `@path/to/file.ts`       | Reference a workspace file                   |
| `@agent-Explore`         | Use the fast codebase exploration agent      |
| `@agent-Plan`            | Use the architecture planning agent          |
| `@agent-<name>`          | Use a custom agent from `.claude/agents/`    |
| `@agent-<plugin>:<name>` | Use an agent provided by an installed plugin |

Custom agents are loaded from `.claude/agents/*.md` (project) and `~/.claude/agents/*.md` (user). Project agents override user agents with the same name. Plugin agents are loaded from enabled plugins' `agents/` directories.

#### Slash Command Autocomplete

- `/`: Trigger command autocomplete popup
- `↑` / `↓`: Navigate suggestions
- `Tab` / `Enter`: Insert selected command
- `Escape`: Close popup

**Built-in commands:**

| Command            | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/clear`           | Clear conversation history               |
| `/compact`         | Compact conversation                     |
| `/rewind`          | Rewind conversation/code to a checkpoint |
| `/review`          | Request code review                      |
| `/security-review` | Security review of changes               |
| `/init`            | Initialize CLAUDE.md                     |

Custom commands are loaded from `.claude/commands/*.md` (project) and `~/.claude/commands/*.md` (user). Plugin commands use the format `/<plugin>:<command>` (e.g., `/myplugin:build`).

### Skills

Skills are specialized tools that extend Claude's capabilities. You can invoke skills in two ways:

**Via slash command (recommended):**

- Type `/skill-name` to invoke a skill directly - it appears in the autocomplete popup alongside regular commands
- Skills invoked this way are **auto-approved** (no approval prompt)
- Pass arguments after the skill name: `/skill-name additional context here`

**Via Claude's autonomous invocation:**

When Claude decides to use a skill on its own, you'll see an approval prompt:

- **Yes**: Approve this invocation (manual mode)
- **Yes, don't ask again**: Auto-approve this skill for the session
- **No**: Deny the skill
- **Tell Claude what to do instead**: Provide custom feedback

Skills are loaded from `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) and `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user). Plugin skills use the format `/plugin:skill-name`. The skill description is parsed from the YAML frontmatter.

### Plugins

Plugins extend Claude's capabilities with additional agents and slash commands. Installed plugins are discovered from:

- **Registry**: `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (managed by Claude Code CLI)
- **Manual**: `<project>/.claude/plugins/*/` directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

Enable or disable plugins from the plugin status panel in the UI. Plugin settings are persisted to Claude's settings files.

**Plugin-provided features:**

| Feature        | Syntax                   | Example               |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Agents         | `@agent-<plugin>:<name>` | `@agent-pdf:analyzer` |
| Slash commands | `/<plugin>:<command>`    | `/pdf:extract`        |

### Provider Profiles

Provider profiles allow you to define and switch between different API providers (Anthropic, Z.AI, OpenRouter, etc.) directly from the settings panel. Each profile stores environment variables that configure the SDK's connection.

**Security:** API credentials are encrypted using VS Code's SecretStorage API (backed by the OS keychain) and never stored in settings.json. Profile names are visible in settings, but all environment variables containing API keys are stored securely.

**Creating a profile:**

1. Open the settings panel (gear icon in chat header)
2. Scroll to "Provider Profiles" section
3. Click "Add Profile"
4. Enter a profile name and add environment variables

**Common environment variables:**

| Variable                         | Purpose                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`             | Custom API endpoint URL                   |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`           | API key or auth token for the provider    |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`   | Model name to use when Opus is selected   |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | Model name to use when Sonnet is selected |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`  | Model name to use when Haiku is selected  |

**Example: Z.AI Profile**

```
Name: zai
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: https://api.zai.com/v1
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN: your-zai-api-key
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

**Per-panel profiles:**

Each open panel can have its own provider profile independent of other panels. The settings panel shows two profile selectors:

- **This panel**: The provider profile for the current panel only
- **Default for new panels**: The global default that new panels inherit when opened

This allows you to have multiple panels open simultaneously, each connected to a different provider (e.g., one panel using OpenRouter while another uses Z.AI).

When you activate a profile, the session automatically restarts with the new provider configuration. Set to "Default" to use the Anthropic API with your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Configuration

| Setting                                | Description                                                                  | Default   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `claude-unbound.permissionMode`        | How to handle tool permissions (`default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`)            | `default` |
| `claude-unbound.maxTurns`              | Maximum conversation turns per session                                       | `100`     |
| `claude-unbound.maxIndexedFiles`       | Maximum files to index for @ mention autocomplete                            | `5000`    |
| `claude-unbound.providerProfiles`      | Array of provider profile names (credentials stored securely in OS keychain) | `[]`      |
| `claude-unbound.activeProviderProfile` | Currently active provider profile name                                       | `null`    |

## Localization

The extension automatically uses VS Code's display language. Currently supported:

| Language | Code |
| -------- | ---- |
| English  | `en` |
| Greek    | `el` |

To change the language, set VS Code's display language via **Configure Display Language** command (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Configure Display Language").

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.95.0 or higher
- Claude Code installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable set (see Authentication below)

## Authentication

Claude Unbound uses the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript), which uses Claude Code as its runtime. **The extension does not handle authentication directly** — it delegates entirely to Claude Code.

```

The SDK uses Claude Code as its runtime. This means:

- All Claude Code authentication methods work automatically
- Sessions persist in `~/.claude/projects/`
- Tool execution, sandboxing, and permissions are handled by Claude Code

### Why Claude Code CLI Is Required

The Claude Agent SDK uses Claude Code as its runtime — it's not a standalone API client. Claude Code provides:

- **Built-in tools** — Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, etc.
- **Authentication** — OAuth session management, API keys, cloud provider credentials
- **Session persistence** — Conversation history stored in `~/.claude/projects/`
- **Sandboxing** — OS-level process isolation for safe command execution
- **Permissions** — Tool approval workflows and permission modes

Your extension calls the SDK API; the SDK handles everything else through Claude Code.

### Setting Up Authentication

**Option 1: API Key (Recommended)**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Get your API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/). This is the officially recommended authentication method for SDK-based applications.

**Option 2: Cloud Providers**

For enterprise environments using cloud-hosted Claude:

| Variable                    | Purpose                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` | Use AWS Bedrock (requires AWS credentials)         |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`  | Use Google Vertex AI (requires GCP credentials)    |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1` | Use Microsoft Foundry (requires Azure credentials) |

### Verifying Authentication

Once authenticated, the extension displays your account info (email, subscription type) in the chat panel header.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build extension and webview
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

## Packaging

To create a distributable `.vsix` file:

```bash
npm run build && npm run package
```

This generates `claude-unbound-<version>.vsix` which can be installed via:

- **VS Code UI**: Extensions → `...` menu → "Install from VSIX..."
- **Command line**: `code --install-extension claude-unbound-<version>.vsix`

## Architecture

- **Extension Host** (Node.js): Handles Claude Agent SDK integration
- **Webview** (Vue 3 + Tailwind): Chat interface
- **postMessage Bridge**: Communication between extension and webview
