# Code Quality Enforcement

**For this request, you MUST:**

- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- No bandaid fixes, fallbacks, or backwards compatibility
- No lazy solutions or "temporary" workarounds
- Remove unused code completely
- Proper error handling, not silent failures

If fixing properly requires more changes, make them.
